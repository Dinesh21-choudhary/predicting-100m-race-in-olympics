# predicting-100m-race-in-olympics
Training the Model with the past Olympic 100m Race data (year,Time) features and predicting the Time for the upcoming years Olympic 100m race
As the dataset is small with two features 1) Year 2) Time and we are predicting the Time for the upcoming Olympic 100m Race Events.
we have to reshape the data of independent variable to feed it into the Linear Regression Model.
After the Reshape I have trained the model and predicted on the same for the accuracy.
Then I have started to predict the Upcoming years of Olypmics like 2020,2024,2028.
The olympics which have to be scheduled at 2020 have been haulted due to covid-19 pandemic but we still have the 100m race winner with Time 9.52679525 seconds but don't know the name of the person we have to wait till the Olympics resumes.
